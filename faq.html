        <summary>What is the main purpose of this VR AI interview simulation?</summary>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                The VR AI interview simulation is designed to replicate real interview scenarios, allowing users to practice answering questions in a simulated IT environment. It evaluates responses and provides feedback on various aspects of performance, such as clarity, technical knowledge, and confidence.

        <summary>How does the voice recognition feature work in the interview simulation?</summary>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                The voice recognition feature in the simulation allows candidates to interact with the AI using their voice. The AI processes the spoken responses, converts them into text, and evaluates them against the expected answers. This mimics a real interview setting where clear and concise communication is key.
